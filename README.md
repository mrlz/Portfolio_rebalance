# Portfolio_rebalance
Toy portfolio example to showcase basic programming.

Ran on Python 3.12.4 under Anaconda3-2024.06-1-Windows-x86_64.

Since only csv and datetime were imported, it should run on vanilla Python no problem.

To run just decompress attached csv data in the same directory as the homework.py file and then, while standing over that folder, run 'python homework.py'.
